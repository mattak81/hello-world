# hello-world
This is my first GitHub repository (((&amp;&amp;&amp;)))
I'm starting to learn about coding ready for doing a master's in digital humanities.
I'd like to understand more about working collaboratively online
setting up and managing projects
and seeing how I can apply this to my studies.
